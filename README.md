# How to use
Remember to install `serde_json` to your Cargo.toml.
Add this repo as a git dependency in the Cargo.toml.
There are two files that can be used as boilerplate. One is an example
demonstrating how to connect to a server and send commands and receive data. 
The other one is an example of receiving and sending data as a server. They are both located in the `examples` folder and can be run with `cargo run --example <name>`. 
They show how the handshake and first move should be made and just prints everything received instead of doing any logic with it.
This repository is a library, so you can use it as a dependency in your own project with:
```toml
[dependencies]
chess-network-protocol = { git = "https://github.com/INDA23PlusPlus/chess-network-protocol" }
```

# How it works
Serde is used to define a JSON schema. We use port 8384 as the default port for historical reasons.
The server is the one that listens on port 8384 and the client is the one that connects to the server.
The server is the one that uses its chess backend for all the chess logik and the client essentially only renders the state of the game and sends the moves to the server.

# Protocol
After a TCP connection is established the protocol is as follows:
1. Client sends the `ClientToServerHandshake` struct
2. Server sends the `ServerToClientHandshake` struct
3. Client sends the `ClientToServer` struct when it is its turn to make a move.
4. Server responds with the `ServerToClient` struct of the `State` variant if the move was legal containing the move of the client in the `move_made` field. If the move was illegal, the server responds with the `ServerToClient` struct of the `Error` variant and we step back to step 3 but the client uses the information in the `Error` variant which ahould be the same as in the previous `State` variant.
5. Server sends the `ServerToClient` struct of the `State` variant when the server has made a move.
6. repeat from step 3.

This is only if the client is white. If the client is black, the server sends the `ServerToClient` struct of the `State` variant first. meaning step 5 would be before step 3.
